the doublerInsert function scales exponentially and the doublerAppend scales linearly.

the doublerAppend scales better in this case because is scales much less compared to doublerInsert.

The reason why doublerAppend scales better than doublerInsert is because when you append a value into an array using the .push
method, it adds it to the end of the array, which requires zero shifting of values previously stored. The doublerInsert uses
the .unshift method, which adds it to the beginning of the array, requiring the rest of the array to shift up an index, which
creates the exponential scaling.
